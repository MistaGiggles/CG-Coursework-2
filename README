Left/Right Arrows : Rotate model Left/Right
F1 : Flat Shading
F2 : Phong Shading
F12: Reset Rotation

Scene:

Teapot Model in the center, with a dim white light as ambient light. There are three "floating" lights each with a distinct color: Red, blue and green.
Different colored lights help show how the differnt lights interact with each other on the teapot.
Simple sloped floor.

The rotation function rotates the model and the floor, the lights are static

Features:
1) Normal vectors computed for each vertice using an average of the face normals for each triangle it is included in
2) Use of a zbuffer to ensure that the scene is rendered in the correct order, with closer triangles overriding trianges at the back
3) Use of Back Face Culling to ignore triangles that are not facing towards the camera
4) Use of barycentric coordinates to determine if a pixel is within a triangle.
5) Use of Phone Illumination Model to calulate ambient light, diffused light and specular highlights
6) Interpolation of vertex normals to produce smooth, rounded faces
7) A simple floor. The floor is initially sloped towards the camera so that it is apparent during rotation. Otherwise the lack of perspective transformation on a flat floor would result in the floor being rendered as a line segment.


Usage:

./comp.sh
Will compile the code

./cg teapot.obj
Will run the program with the teapot model
